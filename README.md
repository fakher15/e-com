# e-com
e-commerce website with Django

## how it works

you just have to setup a virtual envirenment for Django , you can follow this guide https://codesource.io/setting-up-a-virtual-environment-for-your-django-project/ <br>
then cd into this repository and run this command "python manage.py runserver" <br>
the website will be opened at " localhost:8080 "  <br>
thanks for trying it .
