# e-com
e-commerce website with Django

## how it works

you just have to setup a virtual envirenment for Django , you can follow this guide https://codesource.io/setting-up-a-virtual-environment-for-your-django-project/
then cd into this repository and run this command "python manage.py runserver" 
the website will be opened at " localhost:8080 " 
thanks for trying it .
